# Eventra - Event Service Booking Platform

Eventra is a robust Spring Boot application designed to connect customers with various service providers for events. It provides a platform for users to register, browse offered services, make bookings, leave reviews, and communicate with service providers. Service providers can manage their profiles, services, bookings, and track their performance.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following primary packages within `src/main/java/com/cedric/Eventra/`:

-   `controller/`: Contains REST API controllers that handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate to services.
-   `service/`: Houses the core business logic of the application. Interfaces define contracts, and implementation classes (`*ServiceImpl`) contain the logic. This includes sub-packages like `notification/strategy/` for specific patterns.
-   `repository/`: Includes Spring Data JPA repository interfaces for database operations.
-   `entity/`: Defines the JPA entities that map to database tables (data models).
-   `dto/`: (Data Transfer Objects) Used to shape data for API requests and responses.
-   `config/`: Holds Spring configuration classes (e.g., `ModelMapperConfig`, application-wide beans).
-   `security/`: Contains all security-related classes, including JWT utilities, filters, and custom user details services.
-   `exception/`: Defines custom exception classes and a global exception handler for consistent error responses.
-   `enums/`: Contains various enumerations used throughout the application (e.g., `UserRole`, `BookingStatus`, `ServiceCategory`, `NotificationType`).
-   `event/`: (As created for Observer pattern) Holds application event classes (e.g., `BookingCreatedEvent`).
-   `init/`: Contains the `DataInitializer` class for populating the database on startup.

Other important locations:
-   `src/main/resources/application.properties`: Main application configuration file.
-   `src/main/resources/Initialize-images/`: Source images for data initialization.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * JDK 21 or newer
    * Apache Maven 3.6+
    * MySQL Server (ensure it's running)

2.  **Database Configuration:**
    * Create a MySQL database named `eventra` (or as configured in `application.properties`).
    * Currently, database property is set up to `ddl-auto=create-drop` for testing and data initialization, if without data initialization, property can be set up `ddl-auto = update`. 
    * Update the database URL, username, and password in `src/main/resources/application.properties` if different from the defaults:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/eventra
        spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_user
        spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
        ```


3.  **File Upload Directory Configuration:**
    * The application saves uploaded files (profile pictures, cover photos, service images) to local directories.
    * Configure the base path and subdirectories in `application.properties`. Example:
        ```properties
        file.upload-dir.base=/path/to/your/eventra_uploads
        file.upload-dir.profile-pictures=profile-pictures
        file.upload-dir.cover-photos=cover-photos
        file.upload-dir.service-images=service-images
        ```
    * Ensure the base directory (`/path/to/your/eventra_uploads` in the example) is writable by the application. The subdirectories will be created automatically if they don't exist.

4.  **Build the Project:**
    Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    You can run the application using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    Alternatively, you can run the main application class `EventraApplication.java` from your IDE.
    The application will start on port `9090` by default.

## üìñ API Endpoints & Documentation

The application uses Springdoc OpenAPI to generate API documentation. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:

Key API groups include:
* `/api/auth`: User registration and login.
* `/api/users`: User account management.
* `/api/services`: Offered service management (creation by providers, Browse).
* `/api/bookings`: Booking creation and lifecycle management.
* `/api/reviews`: Creating and viewing reviews.
* `/api/notifications`: Managing user notifications.
* `/api/payments`: Simulated payment processing.
* `/api/chat`: Chat room and message management.
* `/api/reports`: Provider dashboard summaries.
* `/uploads/...`: Accessing uploaded files (requires proper serving configuration, e.g., via a resource handler).

## üå± Data Initialization

* The `DataInitializer` class runs on application startup if no users are found in the database. 
* It populates the database with:
    * 3 Admin users.
    * 100 Service Provider users, each with a profile and 3 offered services.
    * 100 Customer users.
    * Randomized reviews for the service providers.
* **Important:** For image initialization without placeholder pictures, we need to have the following default images in the `src/main/resources/Initialize-images/` subdirectories:
    * `profile-pictures/profile-picture.png`
    * `cover-photos/cover-photo.jpg`
    * `service-images/service-image.jpg`

## üìù To-Do / Future Enhancements

* **Full Payment Gateway Integration:** Move beyond simulated payments and integrate a real payment provider like Stripe for bookings and subscriptions.
* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Implement more sophisticated search and filtering for services (e.g., by location, rating, availability, category).
* **Admin Dashboard & Management Tools:** Develop comprehensive admin functionalities (user management, content moderation, site statistics).
* **Email Notifications:** Extend `NotificationServiceImpl` to send email notifications in addition to in-app ones.
* **Enhanced Reporting:** More detailed reports for providers and admins.
* **Calendar Integration:** For managing bookings and availability.
